# Changelog:
# 2011-10-20 inverted VERSION/git-describe precedence. Now VERSION file
#     is considered primary. If it does not exist, run “git describe”.

# Calculates the current version number.  It is content of VERSION file
# if one exists. Otherwise use “git describe” output, modified to conform
# to the versioning scheme that setuptools uses.  On success, version is
# stored into VERSION file.  If “git describe” returns an error
# (most likely because we're in an unpacked copy of a release tarball,
# rather than in a git working copy), that's an error.
#
# To use this script, simply import it your setup.py file, and use the
# results of get_git_version() as your package version:
#
# from get_git_version import get_git_version
#
# setup(
#     version=get_git_version(),
#     .
#     .
#     .
# )
#
# This will automatically update the VERSION file, if
# necessary.  Note that the VERSION file should *not* be
# checked into git; please add it to your top-level .gitignore file.
#
# You'll probably want to distribute the VERSION file in your
# sdist tarballs; to do this, just create a MANIFEST.in file that
# contains the following line:
#
#   include VERSION
